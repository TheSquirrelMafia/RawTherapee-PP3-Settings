# RawTherapee-PP3-Settings
Some PP3 files to help you get started with RawTherapee on Linux & Window.

This is basically a bunch of PP3 files to use with RawTherapee on Linux & Windows. They're a general strating point. I use Pentax cameras, hence the Pentax color PP3 files, but you can just about use these on any camera out there.
